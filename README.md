Client's console version support Linux, macOS and Windows which can install dotnet core runtime lib.  
Client's WPF version only support Windows.  

**Warning Warning Warning** : Because of the working method of client's console version, Playing MinesweeperOnline with console client might led to **your eyes to be blind FOREVER.** Please use WPF version **as much as possible.** **In no way** will the group of development take on any result of this application.

Each app's usage was written in their own project folder.  
My suggestion is that you should compile it by yourself and try it.
